        <h6 className="about-paragraph">
          After working within technology in higher education, I developed an
          interest in programming and completed the University of North Carolina
          - Chapel Hillâ€™s Coding Bootcamp. Full-stack web developer with
          experience working in student services within higher education and the
          full-stack of web development. With excellent attention to detail and
          organizational skills, I am dedicated to building original and
          efficient web applications from start to finish with proficient skills
          in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I enjoy being challenged and working
          outside of my comfort zone. Looking for the perfect match with a
          company that will test and further my knowledge of web development.

          Outside of my professional roles, I enjoy traveling and exploring the
          world. My dream is to live and work abroad, so I can experience life
          from new perspectives. I enjoy spending time with my husband Chris, my
          long-haired chihuahua Rafa, and my chartreux cat Pusheen. I have a
          range of hobbies, including playing tennis, solving jigsaw and
          crossword puzzles, and learning new programming skills.
